   - Click **Confirm**

### Troubleshooting

**Plugin doesn't appear in Tools menu:**
- Check that plugin.js was loaded successfully
- Look for error messages in Blockbench's console
- Ensure you're using Blockbench 4.0+

**Characters appear as colored blocks:**
- This is normal when texture files can't be loaded
- Ensure alphabet directories are in the same folder as plugin.js
- Check that PNG files exist in the alphabet directories

**Export doesn't work:**
- Make sure you've generated text first
- For PNG export, the viewport will be captured
- For BBModel, ensure you have a valid project
